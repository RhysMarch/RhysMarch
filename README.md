# Hi there! I'm Rhys and I enjoy programming!

I started programming at around the age of 16 and I am currently studying Computer Science at Newcastle University. I am interested in Web Development and Cyber Security.

I am more experienced with Python, Web Development (including frameworks such as Django & Bootstrap), and C# but I also have experience with Java, Docker and Linux.
